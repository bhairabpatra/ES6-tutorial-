    <h3>Introduction to the JavaScript spread operator</h3>
    <p>ES6 provides a new operator called spread operator that consists of three dots (...). <br>The spread operator
        allows you to spread out elements of an iterable object such as an array,a map, or a set.</p>

    <b>Summary</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The spread operator is denoted by three dots (…).</li>
        <li>The spread operator unpacks elements of iterable objects such as arrays, sets, and maps into a list.</li>
        <li>The rest paramter is also denoted by three dots (…). However, it packs the remaining arguments of a function
            into an array.</li>
        <li>The spread operator can be used to clone an iterable object or merge iterable objects into one.</li>
