    <h1>Introduction to the JavaScript rest operator</h1>
    <p>ES6 provides a new operator called rest operator that consists of three dots (...). <br>
    <p> The rest parameter is introduced in ECMAScript 2015 or ES6, which improves the ability to handle parameters. The
        rest parameter allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. By using the rest
        parameter, a function can be called with any number of arguments.</p>
    
    <p>Before ES6, the arguments object of the function was used. The arguments object is not an instance of the Array
        type. Therefore, we can't use the filter() method directly.</p>
    
    <p> The rest parameter is prefixed with three dots (...). Although the syntax of the rest parameter is similar to
        the spread operator, it is entirely opposite from the spread operator. The rest parameter has to be the last
        argument because it is used to collect all of the remaining elements into an array.</p>
